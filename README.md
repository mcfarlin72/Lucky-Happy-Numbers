# Lucky-Happy-Numbers
A positive integer is a lucky number if it can be written as the sum of positive integers whose reciprocals sum to 1. A positive integer that is not lucky is an unlucky number. A positive integer is a happy number if it can be written as the product of positive integers whose reciprocals sum to 1, while a positive integer that is not happy is an unhappy number.

This was part of a group project in school.
